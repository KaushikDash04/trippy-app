# 🗺️ Trip Planner Backend

This is the backend server for the Trip Planner application. It provides a robust API to generate AI-powered travel itineraries using LangGraph and other integrated tools, all served via a high-performance FastAPI application.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   **AI-Powered Travel Planning**: Leverages large language models to generate dynamic and personalized travel plans.
-   **Modular & Scalable Architecture**: Code is neatly organized into modules for agents (`agents.py`), data schemas (`schemas.py`), and the core workflow logic (`graph.py`).
-   **High-Performance API**: Built with FastAPI for asynchronous, fast, and reliable API endpoints.
-   **Environment-Based Configuration**: Securely manage secret keys and settings using a `.env` file.
-   **Dockerized Deployment**: Includes a Dockerfile for easy, consistent, and isolated deployments.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Python 3.11+**
-   **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs.
-   **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server for running FastAPI.
-   **LangGraph**: A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
-   **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
-   **python-dotenv**: Reads key-value pairs from a `.env` file and sets them as environment variables.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

To run the application, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your API keys.

**.env**
```env
# Replace with your actual API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-serp-api-key
````

## 📦 Installation

You can run the project either directly on your machine using a virtual environment or with Docker.

### 1\. Standard Installation (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/trip-planner-backend.git](https://github.com/your-username/trip-planner-backend.git)
cd trip-planner-backend

# 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the development server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Your API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and will automatically reload when you make code changes.

### 2\. Docker Installation (Recommended for Production)

Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.

```bash
# 1. Build the Docker image
# This command builds the image and tags it as 'trip-planner-backend'
docker build -t trip-planner-backend .

# 2. Run the Docker container
# The -d flag runs it in detached mode
# The -p flag maps port 8000 on your machine to port 8000 in the container
# The --env-file flag loads your secret keys from the .env file
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env trip-planner-backend
```

Your API will now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 📡 API Endpoints

The primary endpoint for generating a travel plan is detailed below. You can also access the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### `POST /plan-trip`

This endpoint accepts a user's request and returns a generated travel itinerary.

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "message": "I want to plan a 7-day cultural trip to Japan, focusing on Kyoto and Tokyo."
}
```

**Example `curl` command**:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '[http://127.0.0.1:8000/plan-trip](http://127.0.0.1:8000/plan-trip)' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "message": "Plan a 10 day trip to Vietnam"
}'
```

**Success Response (200 OK)**:
The response will be a JSON object containing the detailed travel plan.

```json
{
  "plan": "Day 1: Arrival in Hanoi. Check into your hotel and explore the Old Quarter. Enjoy a traditional water puppet show in the evening.\nDay 2: Hanoi City Tour. Visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, the Temple of Literature, and Hoan Kiem Lake.\nDay 3: Halong Bay Cruise. Travel to Halong Bay and board an overnight cruise to explore the stunning limestone karsts...\nDay 10: Departure from Ho Chi Minh City."
}
```
